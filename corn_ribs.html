        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>4 ears ears corn on the cob</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons "Everything but the Elote seasoning".        </li>
                <li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
                <li>¼ cup grated cotija cheese                </li>
                <li>2 tablespoons Mexican crema, crema fresca                </li>
                <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh cilantro, or more to taste                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 7 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Meanwhile stand corn cobs on the end, and with a sharp knife (I used a wüsthof nakiri) cut each ear down the middle. Place corn cob halves flat on a cutting board and cut in half lengthwise (you will get a total of 4 'ribs' per ear of corn).
                </li>
                <li>Spray each corn rib with non-stick spray. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of seasoning over the 16 corn ribs.

                </li>
                <li>Air fry corn ribs in batches for a total of 12 minutes. Remove from air fryer.

                </li>
                <li>Drizzle crema con sal over corn 'ribs' and sprinkle with cotija cheese and remaining seasoning. Garnish with chopped cilantro.

                </li>
            </ol>
