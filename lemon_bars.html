        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is one of my favorite cookies of all time, although technically they're closer to a pie than a cookie. Nothing prepares you for that intense, awesome sweet-tart lemon flavor and custard, perfectly contrasted against that crisp, sweet buttery shortbread cookie.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <strong>For the shortbread crust:
                </strong>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>½ cup unsalted butter at room temperature
                </li>
                <li>¼ cup confectioners' sugar
                </li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon vanilla extract
                </li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt
                </li>
                <strong>For the lemon layer:
                </strong>
                <li>2 large eggs
                </li>
                <li>1 large egg yolk
                </li>
                <li>1 cup white sugar
                </li>
                <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
                </li>
                <li>¼ cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
                </li>
                <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated lemon zest
                </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon confectioners' sugar, or to taste
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 7 minutes.

                </li>
                <li>Meanwhile stand corn cobs on the end, and with a sharp knife (I used a wüsthof nakiri) cut each ear down the middle. Place corn cob halves flat on a cutting board and cut in half lengthwise (you will get a total of 4 'ribs' per ear of corn).

                </li>
                <li>Spray each corn rib with non-stick spray. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of seasoning over the 16 corn ribs.

                </li>
                <li>Air fry corn ribs in batches for a total of 12 minutes. Remove from air fryer.

                </li>
                <li>Drizzle crema con sal over corn 'ribs' and sprinkle with cotija cheese and remaining seasoning. Garnish with chopped cilantro.

                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
